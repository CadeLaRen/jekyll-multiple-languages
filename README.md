# What is it?

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is very powerful. It is very conveniect to write bolg with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

If we write mainly in English, and sometimes in other languages, now we can do this in a easy way.

### Name rule

THe default language: 

* Page: `$page_name.$ext`. For example:  `index.md`, `about.md`.

* Post: `_posts/$dir_pre/$date-$post_name.$ext`. For example: `_posts/blog/2014-02-26-hi.md`.

The other language, short as `$lang`, put `$lang` and a dot `.` after `$page_name` or `$post_name`

* Page:  `page_name.$lang.$ext`, for example: 

    `index.md` => `index.cn.md`

* Post: `_posts/$dir_pre/$date-$post_name.$ext`

    `2014-02-26.hi.md` => `2014-02-26-hi.cn.md`

### Build result

* The default language will build into destination directory as usually, `_site`, for example.

* The other language (mark as: `$lang`), will build into the subdirectory `/$lang` in the destination directory. 

    For example: `_site/$lang`. If the `$lang` is `en`, will be built into `_site/en`.


# Installation & Configure

### Installation

```bash
gem install jekyll-multiple-languages
```

If you want you use pagination, you should install `jekyll-paginate` as well.

```bash
gem install jekyll-paginate
```

### Configure

* ####  `_config.yml`

    ```yaml
    # add this plugin to gems
    gems:           ['jekyll-multiple-languages']
    # if you want to use pagination, you should add jekyll-paginate into gems
    # and make sure it is in front of jekyll-multiple-languages
    # gems:           ['jekyll-paginate', 'jekyll-multiple-languages']

    # The all languages used
    languages:          ['en', 'cn']
    
    # If not config, the first item of languages will be used as the default.
    language_default:   'en'
    ```

# Variables

### Variables for pages and posts

* `page.language`

    The language in this Page or Post.

* `page.is_default_language`

    If this Page or Post is in the default language, its value is `true`

### Variables only for posts

*   `page.next_in_language`

    Next post in the same language with this post.

*   `page.previous_in_language`

    Previous post in the same language with this post.

### Variables for site

*   `site.pages_by_language`

    It is all the `site.pages` grouped by languages. 
    
    It is a hash. The key is the language and the value is all of the Pages in this kind of language.

    The value is a list.

*   `site.posts_by_language`

    It is similar to `site.pages_by_language`, contains all the `site.posts` grouped by languages.

### The sample of variables

# Data

* You can create a data file in the directory `_data`, for example: `i18n.yaml`:

    ```yaml
    en:
        previous_page: Previous
        next_page:    Next
    
    cn:
        previous_page: 上一页
        next_page:    下一页
    ```

* Then use the language variables in `pagination.html`:

    ```html
    <li>
    <a href="{{ "{{ paginator.previous_page_path " }}}}" aria-label="Previous">
        <span>{{ "{{ site.data.i18n[page.language].previous_page " }}}}</span>
    </a>
    </li>
    ```

# Paginate

**This plugin enables that we can write blog in multiple languages easily, it also enables that we can use any files that end with differents extensions.**

### The template

*   Page named `index.*` is the paginate template for default language, no limited to `index.html`.

    For example: `index.md`, `index.html`.

*   Page named `index.$lang.$ext`  is the paginate template for the other languages(short for `$lang`).

    For example: `index.cn.md`, `index.html`.

### The variables

*   Same with [jekyll-paginate](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/)
